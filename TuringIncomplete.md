## Turing Incomplete Languages

  In my previous blog, I learned about Alan Turing and his work as well as his legacy on programming languages, Turing Complete languages. However, I never thought to think about incomplete Turing languages and even so to consider them useful. In Neil Mitchell's blog he talk's about the Turing Incomplete languages and gives Haskell as an example. Now I actually don't agree with this, but again I am still learning.
