## Final Thoughts

  To be completly honest, I did struggle in this class. It took time to figure out the concepts. What did help was talking over the logic of the program. When I did that, I tended to better understand the outcome and the logic behind the language. As hard as the assignments were, I figured it out and overcame them (it did take many back and forth emailsðŸ˜…). Looking back, now that I am done with the assignments, they were all fun in there own way and tought me the fundamentals of programming languages. 
  
  One thing I would think would be very useful for future classes would be to include answers for the homework or excerscies a week or two after they are assigned. That would make the topics stick as well as the students who are checking their work are the ones who have already done it. If the homework is never graded then students wouldn't bother checking their answers. 
  
  Having heard from other students about this class and the difference in structure, I really liked the lesson plans and way the class was organized as well as the projects. I liked how they were in the same language or flowed from one another. 


Overall, as hard and stressful as this semester was, I enjoyed this class. The topics introduced will stick with me as they weren't simple to solve. The work I put in the projects and assignments were meaningful and are a product of my understanding behind the programming language.
