# Assignment 1: Part 1

For assignment 1 we had to use recursion over algebraic data types. This assignment was a little confusing for me in the beginning. 
I went to office hours that that helped me understand the logic behind the functions. 
Once I became used to the data types, the assignment went smoothly. 
The first part included functions in

  * Natural numbers
  * Postive numbers
  * Fractions
  
To be honest, I did not see the point of Haskell untill I finished the assignment. For each function, you had to simplify it and think critically. It slightly made me a better programmer to think of the algorithms to solve the problems.
