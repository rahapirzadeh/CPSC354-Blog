# Assignment 1: Part 1

For assignment 1 we had to use recursion over algebraic data types. This assignment was a little confusing for me in the beginning. 
I went to office hours that that helped me understand the logic behind the functions. 
Once I became used to the data types, the assignment went smoothly. 
The first part included functions in

  * Natural numbers
  * Postive numbers
  * Fractions
