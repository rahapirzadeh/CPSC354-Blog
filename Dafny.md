## Dafny Programming Language 

# Background
   Dafny is a programming language with imperative and functional features. This programming language implements reasoning in Hoare logic. Hoare logic is a formal system, or the inferring of theorems from axioms according to a set of rules, with a set of logical rules for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs. Using standard Hoare logic, only partial correctness can be proven, while termination needs to be proved separately.
